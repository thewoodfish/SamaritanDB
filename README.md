# samaritanDB (Key-Value Database)

Assuming you've read the <a href="https://algorealm.gitbook.io/samaritanos-a-d-system-for-digital-identity">SamaritanOS wiki</a>, you know why we are working on SamaritanDB and why it is important. 


SamaritanDB (KVD) is a decentralised and distributed key-value database that plays a great role in bringing our vision for the internet to fruition.
