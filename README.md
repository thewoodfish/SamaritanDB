# SamaritanDB (Key-Value Database)

Assuming you've read the [SamaritanOS wiki](https://algorealm.gitbook.io/samaritanos-a-d-system-for-digital-identity), you know why we are working on SamaritanDB and why it is important. 
<br>
SamaritanDB (KVD) is a decentralised and distributed key-value database which plays a great role in bringing our vision for the internet to fruition.
<br>
## Prototype
In our bid to break through assumptions and barriers, we have build a prototype that works - version 1.0 (Chevalier). This prototype makes applications store data in a way that leaves control to the user and is free of every centralised storage provider. It is distributed and decentralized. The prototype is also fastly changing as ideas and thinking are being refined and reshaped to create the most effective and efficient product. We will not decieve ourselves.
<br>
## Testing the prototype
You can download the prototype from the page for your suitable devices and configure (nothing to do really) and run them immediately to test the database network.
## Stack
- The database is written in Rust.
- It is built with libp2p as its major networking stack.
- It interacts very often with IPFS
- It also interacts periodically with the [SamaritanOS contract](https://github.com/algorealmInc/samaritanos-contract).
